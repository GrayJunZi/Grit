<p>If you are interested in Asp .Net Core Web API and have less time to learn, you can focus on:</p><p>- Sections 1 to 7</p><p>- Sections 12 to 15</p><p>- Section 18</p><p>- Sections 20 to 25 (optional, but requires some based knowledge in MVC controllers and views)</p><p>- Sections 26 to 30 (Web API and Minimal API)</p><p><br></p><p>But note that the skipped sections are also logically related to web api (such as unit testing etc.,). So you should come back in the near future.</p>
