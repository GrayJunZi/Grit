<p>I encourage you to give this method a try. Here's how you can implement it:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Watch the course videos uninterrupted</strong>, focusing on grasping the overall concepts and maintaining full concentration. Don't worry about understanding every detail at this stage. You can also watch it at 1.5x or 2x speed at this stage.</p></li><li><p>Watch the videos a second time, but this time, <strong>split them into smaller chunks</strong>. Follow along with your own copy of the code, allowing yourself to dive deeper into the implementation details.</p></li><li><p>Once you feel comfortable with the material, it's time to put your newfound knowledge into practice. <strong>Experiment with the code, make modifications</strong>, and explore different possibilities. Embrace the opportunity to make mistakes and think outside the box, as this is where true learning occurs.</p></li></ol>
